# Rules:
  1. The rules are intended as guidelines to maximize your enjoyment of
     the challenge as opposed to ensuring it is unhackable. Thus, it is
     recommended that you follow their spirit rather than their letter.
  2. You may not modify any of the existing files.
  3. You must launch and interact with the challenge via reading.py.
     reading.py is designed to be run from the command line.
  4. This is part of reading, so you are free to do as much of that as you
     please.
  5. The challenge has a well-defined end. If you encounter difficulties,
     consider that this is a reading group.
